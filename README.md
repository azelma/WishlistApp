This is a wishlist app. Create a wishlist for collaborative gift-giving. You can add collaborators and commenters. Collaborators can add items to the list just like you. Commenters can't add items to the list, but they can see your items and make comments that you and the other collaborators can't see (so they can plan out what to get you). Once you make a wishlist, you can add items to it. Choose items from the exisisting data or add more yourself. You can either add items manually or add items from Amazon by URL (Using the Amazon Product Advertising API). You can browse the existing items by merchant or category.

Note: Code cloned from Github should work fine, with the exception of the Amazon lookups, as I have not included the API keys in the repository. For a working version, see the deployed app at http://wishlist-app.herokuapp.com/
